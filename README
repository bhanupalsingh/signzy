I am using node js with socket.io library.

Run
1) First run server by :- node chat-server
2) Now open as many terminal as you want and start client on it:- node chat-client userName
3) Now from any client you can pass message to all users(basically broadcast to all users);
4) to run linux command on client you need to pass message in `message` for . here start and end char should be `.
Example `ls` 
5) for encryption and decryption of message I took random public key and private key. which also attacehd in current project.
6) message  take from message.txt and send to whom I dont have enough clarity on this . so escapr this part.
